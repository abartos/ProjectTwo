								  The Growler April 2016<br>
 
								  OMNI Brewing will introduce “An Homage to Brewing in Minnesota,” an eleven foot, commissioned oil painting that will permanently grace its taproom walls.

								 Loren Green January 2016 <br>
 
								 Some breweries open with a bang, others quietly. Omni Brewing Co. falls more on the softer side of things. The Maple Grove brewery opened this past fall and has been serving the local market since, making their beer in-house and for a select few hyperlocal establishments in their surrounding western suburb. </div>

			<div id="paragraph3"><h3>OMNI Brewing Makes a Splash in Maple Grove</h3>
								 Cyd Haynes January 2016<br>
 
								 Finally! Our corner of the Twin Cities gets its very own brewpub. No longer must we trek down to the Northeast neighborhood of Minneapolis to be trendy and relevant. Yes, you can get a great local brew at Granite City or 3 Squares, but now you can chug a craft beer that’s minutes 
								 old in an official taproom.
